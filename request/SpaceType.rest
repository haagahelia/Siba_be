### Note: spaceType doesn't have put and delete methods

### Reset database in admin env before performing other tests
GET {{host}}/resetDatabase
Authorization: Basic {{token}}

### 1. Get all spaceTypes to have a general overview
GET {{host}}/spacetype
Authorization: Basic {{token}}

### Initial setup: Set the nextId after Testdata Reset
### It should come after the last id in test data
@nextId=5005

### 2. Get one by id (use existing id)
GET {{host}}/spacetype/5001
Authorization: Basic {{token}}

### 3. Create new SpaceType (Assume that the created building gets `nextId` or should be replaced with a returned ID to continue with the test)
POST {{host}}/spacetype
Authorization: Basic {{token}}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "testType",
    "acronym": "name acronym",
    "description": "a test spaceType"
}

### 4. Confirm the newly created equipment using the `nextId` (This will verify creation was successful and the correct ID was assigned)
GET {{host}}/spacetype/{{nextId}}
Authorization: Basic {{token}}

### 5. Create new building without description
POST {{host}}/spacetype
Authorization: Basic {{token}}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "No desc spaceType",
    "acronym": "Name acronym"
}

### 6. Create building with empty string description
POST {{host}}/spacetype
Authorization: Basic {{token}}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "Empty string desc spaceType",
    "acronym": "Name acronym",
    "description": ""
}

### 7. Create several buildings at a time (Testing the adding of multiple buildings operation)
POST {{host}}/spacetype/multi
Authorization: Basic {{token}}
Content-Type: application/json

[
    {
    "name": "multi1",
    "description": "descriptiondescription"
    },

    {
    "name": "multi2"
    }
]

### 8. Update the spacetype using `nextId` (Test the update operation)
PUT {{host}}/spacetype
Authorization: Basic {{token}}
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": {{nextId}},
    "name": "Updated name",
    "acronym": "Updated acronym",
    "description": "Updated Description"
}

### 9. Confirm the update (Ensure the update took effect)
GET {{host}}/spacetype/{{nextId}}
Authorization: Basic {{token}}

### 10. Delete the building (Test the delete operation)
DELETE {{host}}/spacetype/{{nextId}}
Authorization: Basic {{token}}

### 11. Confirm deletion (Trying to retrieve it should result in an 400 error)
GET {{host}}/spacetype/{{nextId}}
Authorization: Basic {{token}}
